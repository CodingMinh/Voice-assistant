In this personal project I developed a voice assistant using Python. This assistant with GUI is a user-friendly application designed to interact with users using voice commands and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy control.

Features include text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion, telling the time, playing music, opening Google/Youtube/StackOverflow, answering questions, searching the web, performing calculations, fetching weather data, delivering top news, etc. The voice assistant can be customized for more features as needed.

Simply download main.py and load it up in VS Code

# Note that you have to install some libraries listed in the main before running, and this project was made and tested in VS Code only. Some files are left there in my attempt to turn this into a downloadable app, but I have yet to figure that out.
